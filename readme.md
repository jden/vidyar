the name really sucks but oh well - it's super experimental

insert selfies into chats and things

it's a chrome extension for now, mostly because my webrtc stuff is broken in firefox aurora on my machine

## usage

install it as an unpackaged chrome extension:

 - Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the settings menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
 - Ensure that the Developer Mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
 - Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
 - Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live(Go to Root Folder of manifest.json file) , and select it.

then, from a text box on some page where you want to insert a selfie, double-tap `ctrl` to bring up the preview window. then hit `enter` to take a selfie, upload it to imgur, and insert the image url into the focused text field. you'll have to manually hit enter or whatever again to get it to go.
